FFT.DOC

     The Pascal programs PASFFT1.SRC thru PASFFT4.SRC use several
different techniques to calculate the Fast Fourier Transform. The
programs have been tested with and without the AMD 9511. The times
and the advantages of each are described. Written by J.A. Koehler,

FFTKF.DOC
FFTKF.PAS
FFTLIB.PAS

     This is an implementation of the radix-2, fast Fourier Transform
algorithm with decimation in time (Cooley-Tukey method). There are
many methods of computing discrete Fourier transforms in order
(N log N) floating point operations. FFTKF.PAS represents an efficient
, but relative straight forward approach well suited to micro-
processors. Written by Kurt Fickie, 144 So. Catalina, CA 91106

FACT2K.DOC
FACT2K.PAS

     This program will analize experimental data from a 2**k factorial
design. As an example, you could determine the effects and inter-
actions of multiple variables such as temperature, pressure, flow
etc. in a study of conversion yield of a catalytic reaction.

LAB.PAS

     A program for computer control of laboratory equipment using
A/D and D/A interface boards. See article in Newsletter #9.

     The PASMAT Pascal/MT reformatter source code for use by
a CPM-80 (8080/Z80) system. Files with the same name but ending
in .PAS, .SU, and .IN are for use on a CPM-86 system. Written
