
This package was originally issued for the OSBORNE 1.
The MUSIMP.COM file contains my patch to make it useable
under generic cp/m.  The original osborne version of this
executable is enclosed as MUSIMP.OBJ

The CLES?.* files are a tutorial in using the calculation
parts of MUMATH.  The PLES?.* comprise a programming tutorial
for MUSIMP.
