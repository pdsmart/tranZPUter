
  The command 'SHIFT  <file1>  <file2>'  reads the pascal source in
  file2  and shifts everything not between quotes  ''  or curly
  brackets  {}  to upper-case.  This means that  file1  afterwards
  contains the program with everything but strings and comments
  (curly bracket comments only)  in upper case.

  SHIFT was written by T. W. Lougheed in TINY PASCAL (r).
