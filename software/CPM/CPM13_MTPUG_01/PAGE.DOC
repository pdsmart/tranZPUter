
  The command  'PAGE <file>'  causes a file to be displayed a-page-at-
  a-time on the console.  At the end of every 23 rd line, PAGE will print
  the prompt 'MORE...' at the bottom corner of the screen, any response
  except  ESC, ^Q, ^C, ^X, ^Z, 'Q', 'q', 's', 'S', 'N', or 'n'  will
  abort the program.

  WARNING:  PAGE uses  character  1A hex  to clear the screen, and assumes
  an  80-by-24  screen.

  PAGE was written in PASCAL/MT by  T. W. Lougeed  and is in the public
  domain.
