  provide complete and correct pascal source for all the trancendental
  functions vended with PASCAL/MT 5.1.  They are in all cases more
  or just as accurate and more efficient.   The arctangent, as noted in 
  the source, fixes a bug in the  MT 5.1  function, which returns
  incorrect answers for large arguments.  The  logarithm is stable for
  large numbers, which the  MT 5.1  logarithm is not  (starts giving
  wild answers).  The function  EXP  is vastly more efficient for
  large numbers than the  MT 5.1  logarithm.   The sine and cosine
  are probably just about the same.

  The user may compile and link these modules separately and link
  them before linking  TRANCEND,  or may combine the  RELocatable
  modules using the MT-Librarian to make a new library to replace
  TRANCEND.
