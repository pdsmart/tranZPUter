A Personal Note
===============

Somehow, I've managed to get by for the last 14 years using just ZCPR.
But like some of you, I have fiddled with the standard ZCPR and
modified it to suit my tastes.  As I added new commands or enriched old
ones, I've always remained compatible with existing programs, all the
BDOS replacements, and, most important of all, stayed within the 800H
space allocation of the original Digital Research CCP.  Here are the
fruits of my labors, I hope you enjoy this CCP replacenow have options to turn on or off page breaks.  Moreover, the
console check for abort has been improved.

Two commands have been added for use in submit files - SAK and BELL.
These commands allow you to pause or ring the bell during submit file
execution.

Before you install this version of ZCPR onto your boot disks, try it by
running it as a .com file.  Just edit the few customizing options and
assemble the source.  After you decide it really is better, load it
onto your boot track and make it yment as much as I
do.

Introduction
============

This console replacement is designed to run under CP/M 2.2 or any of
the 2.2 BDOS replacements.  It requires a Z80 or better.  If you are
running DRI's CCP or older versions of ZCPR1, this program is a
significant improvement.  If you are running ZCPR3, CP/M 3.0, CP/M
Plus, or MP/M, this will probably be a disappoiour standard.  Complete instructions
are located at the end of this document.

The complete built-in command list is:

    DIR - directory command enhanced to list optionally all user areas
    REN - standard rename command
    USER- move to new user number area on same drive
    SAVE- save specified number of TPA pages or records in a file
    TYPE- display a file on the console with optional page break pauses
    LIST- print command plus optional form feed insertion
    PAGE- send form feed to ntment.

If you are familiar with ZCPR3, you will recognize many of the
enhancements here: comments on a command line, search path for the .com
file, drive/user change with simple du:, CLEVEL3 command processing,
proper SUBMIT file facility, and so on.  Nothing has been removed from
DRI's CCP, only new features added.  AND IT ALL STILL FITS IN THE
ORIGINAL 800H, THE SAME SPACE AS THE DIGITAL RESEARCH FIVE COMMAND
CCP.

Many of the standard commands have been enhanced.  For example, TYPE
and LIST list device
    ERA - standard file erase command
    ERAQ- file erase with confirmation query at each file
    DFU - set default user number for .com search path
    BELL- send a bell character to the console
    SAK - pause until a key is struck on the console (Strike Any Key)
    SCL - toggle multiple commands per line (Single Command on a Line)
    GET - load a file into the TPA at any specified location
    JUMP- process command tail and execute program at specified address
    GO  - process c type 'junk*.'.  The
question mark still works as a single character wild card.


Command Line Processing
=======================

The  current user number is included as part of the command prompt for
all non-zero user numbers.  The prompt is of the form du>, for example
A2> or B10>.  If the SUPRES equate is true, the user number is
suppressed for user 0 only.

Multiple commands are typed on a single line separated by a command
separator character.  Occasionally, you need to type the separatorommand tail and execute program loaded at 100H
    PEEK- display hexadecimal byte string starting with specified address
    POKE- load hexadecimal byte string starting with specified address
    BOOT- execute BIOS cold boot routine


Filename Processing
===================

The standard ZCPR3 du: drive/user file specification has been
implemented.  Any filename can be in the du:fn.ft form.  For example:

       A>era c4:junk*.*

erases files on the C drive, user area 4 without leaving drive A
character in a command tail.  The SCL command toggles the multiple
command enable.  The CMDCHR equate determines the command separator
character.  A ';' has been chosen as the separator character in this
distribution version.

Comments are allowed on a command line.  When the comment separator
character is encountered as the first character of a command, the
remainder of the line is ignored.  The COMCHR equate determines the
comment separator character.  A ';' has been chosen as the separator
cha user
0.  When a user number is found in a filename, that user number is
placed in S1 of the default FCB.  Bit 7 of S1 is set to inform the
program using the FCB a user number was found.

The * in an ambiguous file name has been improved.  Now a trailing *
causes the remainder of the ambiguous name to be filled with '?', not
just the fn field.  For example:

       A>era c4:junk*

is the same as the example above.  Previously, junk* was defined as
'junk????.   '.  If you need the ft field blank,racter in this distribution version.  Here is an example containing
comments and multiple commands on a single line:

   A>get 100 junk;peek 100;;this is a comment.
   A>;this is also a comment.

There exists a built-in search path for transient commands.  First, the
current drive/user is searched.  Next, the current drive/default user
is searched.  Last, drive A/default user is searched.  The DEFUSR
equate determines the default user number, currently set to user 0 in
this distribution version.  PR is entered at CPRLOC+3 jump, default command
processing is suppressed.  Either way, register C must contain a valid
drive/user, just like the original CCP.


Submit File Processing
======================

A basic design choice had to be made in the design of ZCPR concerning
the execution of submit files. The original CCP had a problem.  It
ALWAYS looked for the $$$.SUB file on drive A and the submit program
would place it on the current default drive.  When the you were logged
onto drive B anThe default user is temporarily changed
with the DFU command.  If a drive is specified in the transient
command, the current and default user areas on the specified drive are
searched.  If a user number is specified, that user area on the current
and default drive are searched.  If both the drive and user number are
specified, no search is performed.  The same drive/user area is never
searched twice.

Transient commands are always "called."  If a program terminates via a
return rather than a warm bd you issued a submit command, the $$$.SUB was placed on
drive B and not executed.

After much debate it was decided to have ZCPR perform the same type of
function as CCP (look for the $$$.SUB file on drive A), but the problem
with SUBMIT.COM still exists.  Hence, RGF designed SuperSUB and RLC
took his SuperSUB and designed SUB from it; both programs are set up to
allow the selection at assembly time of creating the $$$.SUB on the
default drive or on drive A.  If you don't have one of these newer
soot, subsequent multiple commands on the
command line are executed.  Any program exiting by a warm boot reloads
ZCPR and the subsequent commands lost.

A default command can be placed in the command buffer and control
passed to ZCPR for processing.  The only thing required, besides
placing the command in the buffer and jumping to CPRLOC, is to
initialize the command character counter at the start of the buffer.
The procedure is compatible with the original DRI CCP default command
processing.  If ZCubmit programs, a procedure for patching the standard SUBMIT.COM has
been included at the end.

The fixed drive choice permits a submit file to contain a series of
commands exactly as they would be entered from a CP/M console.  This
permits things like:

    A>dir
    A>b:
    B>dir

to be executed, even though the currently default drive is changed
during execution. If the $$$.SUB file were present on the default
drive, the above series of commands would not work.  ZCPR would be
looking for $ If there is a conflict between an internal ZCPR command
and a transient program of the same name, the internal command is
executed.  Type the command with the du: included if the external
transient command is the one desired.  Here is a complete alphabetized
list of all the resident commands with their syntax:

=============================================================================

Command:  BELL

Function: To ring terminal bell.

Forms:    BELL

Options:  None.

Uses:     This comma$$.SUB on the default drive, and switching default drives
without moving the $$$.SUB file would cause processing to abort.  Note
that the same problem occurs if the user number of the $$$.SUB file is
not predefined. ZCPR assumes that the $$$.SUB file is located on user 0
of drive A.

The trick of using the $ flag returned by the BDOS disk reset is used
to speed the search for a $*.* file on drive A. This trick will not
work if the $$$.SUB file were located on another drive.

The '>' prompt charactnd is designed to be placed in a submit file to
          ring the bell to indicate significant checkpoints.

=============================================================================

Command:  BOOT

Function: To execute BIOS cold boot routine.

Forms:    BOOT

Options:  REBOOT equate controls the inclusion/exclusion of this command.

Uses:     Reboots the system without pushing the reset button.  The
          cold boot entry point in the BIOS must be supported for this
          commaner is replaced by a special character while a
submit file is in execution.  The SPRMPT equate defines this special
character, currently set to '$' in this distribution version.


Command Syntax
==============

Multiple commands can be placed on one line.  If the comment character
is encountered where a command should start, the rest of the line is
ignored.  Any command can be renamed by editing the command table.
Command names can be up to eight characters long and are terminated by
bit 7 high. d to work.

=============================================================================

Command:  DFU

Function: To set the Default User Number for transient commands.

Forms:    DFU <usrnum>

Options:  DEFUSR equate defines the default user choice until this
          command is entered.

          NUMBASE equate defines the character that specifies a
          hexadecimal number.  The distribution version is set to 'H'.

Uses:     The default user area is searched after a transient comm

          FENCE equate specifies the character separator between the
          directory columns.

          USRDLM equate specifies the character between the user number
          and the filename.

          USRFLG, SYSFLG, and SOFLG equates specify the command line
          tail character that control the display of system and
          non-system files.

Uses:     Displays a directory listing of files in specific drive/user
          area.

=============================================and
	  cannot be found in the current user area.  If the transient
	  command still has not been found, the default user on the
	  default drive is searched last.  The new default user number
	  is in decimal, but hexadecimal numbers are entered by
	  appending an 'H'.  The next warm boot will restore the
	  original default user number.

=============================================================================

Command:  DIR

Function: To display a directory listing of the files on a drive.================================

Command:  ERA

Function: To erase files.

Forms:    ERA <afn>

Options:  None.

Uses:     Deletes files.  Names of erased files are displayed.

=============================================================================

Command:  ERAQ

Function: To erase files with individual query.

Forms:    ERAQ <afn>
          <afn>? y          File erased
          <afn>? <CR>       File not erased

Options:  None.

Uses:     Deletes a subset of a set of ambi

Forms:    DIR <afn>       Display the DIR files
          DIR <afn> S     Display the SYS files
          DIR <afn> B     Display both DIR and SYS files
          DIR <afn> A     Display both DIR and SYS files for all user areas

Options:  TWOCOL equate controls the number of columns in the display.
          Forty-column terminals are limited to two-column displays.

          WIDE equate controls the spacing between the columns and
          change the horizontal width of a directory display.Acorn
