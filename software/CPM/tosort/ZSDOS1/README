This Basic Disk Operating System is an enhanced CP/M 2.2 compatible
core tailored for efficient operating on Z80 processors.  It is
coded for assembly by the SLR Systems SLR180 or Z80ASMP assemblers,
as well as Al Hawley's ZMAC assembler (NOT Echelon's or Hi-Tech's
ZMAC assemblers).  Assembly is possible under other assemblers with
appropriate modifications to conditional assembly directives and/or
arguments coded with square brackets ({}).

To assemble a relocatable image of the ZSDOS, first edit ZSDOS.LIB
to reflect your desired options.  Among the more important options
are:

  ZS   - If Set to True, the ZSDOS variant will be produced which
	requires an external clock driver and File stamping module.
	These are tailored to various combinations of the DateStamper,
	P2DOS (CP/M+), or NZTIM stamp methods with utility routines
	in a separate package.  If Set to False, the ZDDOS variant is
	produced which contains support for ONLY DateStamper file
	stamps, but with internal drivers and NO support for the DOS
	search path and other minor features.

  ZSDOS11  - This flag, when set to True assembles a version
	compatible to the released rev level which has been a
	commercial product since 1988.  The released utilities are
	set for this version as distributed.  A later 1.2 version was
	produced but never distributes.  Setting this flag to False
	will require reassembly and rebuilding of support modules to
	permit an operating installation.

  ZRL  - This flag provides a Named Common label needed by NZCOM and
	other Z-System components if set to True.  When set to False,
	this label is not embedded in the relocatable file.

If you are Not running a ZCPR-based command processor, many of the
remaining equates are unimportant, but examine them and set any
values you need to system parameters.

Assemble the program to a Microsoft Relocatable file (default type of
.REL) and rename the output file type to .ZRL if you had the ZRL
equate set to True in ZSDOS.LIB.  You may then use the output file
directly in an NZ-COM build, installation per the manual with
utilities provided in a separate file, or link to an absolute image
for manual installation.
