
	BD Software C Compiler v1.6
	---------------------------

This document shows all minor bugs found and enhancements made to v1.6 since
its initial release. Note that the revision designator (as in "rev b" below,
12/23/86) does not appear in the sign-on message, but only at the top of the
READ.ME file. The rev letter changing is considered a very minor change.


Date	 New vsn. #.	Description
---- 	 -----------	-----------

11/12/86   1.60		v1.60 initial release
11/25/86   none		LONG.C was missing; added (identical to v1.5 version)
12/17/86   none		BDSCIO.H, DEFF15.CRL added for 1.5 source compatibility
   "	    "		HARDWARE.H was missing; added (identical to v1.5)
12/18/86   none		CLIB.COM sign-on message fixed.
12/23/86   1.60 rev b   read() function fixed so as not to set an error code
			number on simple EOF condition. This is significant to
			help distinguish between an EOF and ERROR condition
			returned by the buffered I/O functions (see note #1 at
			the end of READ.ME)
1/15/87	   none		External addresses given in L2.C compilation
			instructions increased by 100h.
9/7/88	   1.60 rev c   "fopen" function fixed so "a" mode works correctly.
