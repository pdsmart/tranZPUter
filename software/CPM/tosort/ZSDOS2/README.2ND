GETTINÇ STARTED.

     The natural human inclination is to start using products 
before wading through the instructions.  We understand that and 
have developed some rather simple steps to provide initial ZSDOS 
capabilities rather painlessly.  This will provide the inducement 
to read the appropriate sections of the manual for a complete 
customized installation.  Merely follow the steps listed here, 
then read the manual at your liesure to learn how to tailor the 
ZSDOS system to you particular needs and desires.  These instruc
tions cite the relevant paragraphs in the manual in case a more 
detailed description is desired.

1® LOADINÇ THÅ DOS  These steps are written around the full-
featured ZSDOS version of the Operating System to demonstrate all 
of the power, and provide procedures for systems already using 
either type of Time Stamping supported by ZSDOS.  It is recom
mended that these steps be followed initially, followed by a 
later installation with ZDDOS if either a minimal memory configu
ration is desired, or only DateStamper-type File Stamping is 
desired.  The differences between ZSDOS and ZDDOS are briefly 
described in Section 1 of the manual.

    A. DO YOU OPERATE UNDER NZ-COM?                   (3.1.2)
	If No, Go To Step B.
	If Yes,

		Rename ZSDOS.ZRL to NZDOS.ZRL and replace your
		existing NZDOS.ZRL with this new file.  Reinstall
		NZCOM and load the system.

		Go to Step 2.

    B. DO YOU HAVE Plu*Perfect Systems' JETLDR?       (3.1.3)
	If No, Go To Step C.
	If Yes,

		Type:
			JETLDR ZSDOS.ZRL

		Go to Step 2.

    C. ARE YOU USING AN SB-180/FX-180 with XBIOS?     (3.1.4)
	If No, Go To Step D.
	If Yes,

		Enter SYSBLD with your current system model.
		Select Menu 1.1, and change the DOS name to
		ZSDOS.ZRL.  Exit SYSBLD, and "XBOOT" the new image.

		Go to Step 2.

    D. YOU ARE INSTALLING TO A BOOTABLE SYSTEM IMAGE. (3.1.1)

	(1) Create a system image file with MOVCPM, MOVZSYS or
	    whatever facility you computer uses (ONEAC ON!
	    image is already in this form).  Save the moved
	    system image to a disk file remembering the name.


	(2) Call the ZSDOS Installation tool in absolute mode
	    (3.1.1.1) with:
			INSTALOS /A
	    Read in the image created above, and select option
	    2 to replace the DOS.  Load the ZSDOS.ZRL file and
	    answer 'N' (No) to the prompt asking whether to
	    configure default options.  Select menu option 4 to
	    exit the program and save the new image.

	(3) Install the new image on your system boot tracks
	    with the SYSGEN utility provided with your computer.
	    WARNING: PERFORM THIS STEP ON A WORKING DISK, NOT A
	    MASTER DISK.  Reboot your system from this disk and
	    you will be operating under ZSDOS.


2. You should have completed installation of one of the forms in
step 1 at this point, and have ZSDOS up and running.  To see what
Time Stamps can do for your system, two files have been pre-
configured on the distribution disk.  LDTIMD.COM is an RSX form
of DateStamper with the Relative clock.  LDTIMP.COM is an RSX form
of P2DOS stamping also with the Relative clock.  If you are
unfamiliar with the two methods, a brief comparison is:

  Stamp Method        Advantages          Disadvantages
  ------------        ----------          -------------
  DateStamper(tm)     Wide acceptance     Slight Time penalty
                      Uses Only 1 Dir     Stamp file can be
                        entry               erased
                      Offers Last Access
                        stamp

  P2DOS (CP/M Plus)   Fast                Uses 1/4 of Dir
                                            Entries

If you do NOT want Date/Time Stamp or clock support, go to
Step 3, otherwise activate one of the two programs by entering
either LDTIMD or LDTIMP (see LDTIM, 3.2.3).  Then Set the clock
using TD.COM (4.6).

To see the effect of stamping, prepare a disk for stamping with
PUTDS.COM (3.2.4) if you selected LDTIMD, or INITDIR.COM (3.2.5)
if you selected LDTIMP.  Copy or edit some files and note the
effect with ZXD (4.11).  You will probably want to tailor the
stamping to your system clock or other parameters now, so please
read Section 3 of the manual for details.


3. FINAL TOUCHES.  After you have completed whichever of the above 
steps you elected, we recommend highly that you read at least 
Sections 1 and 2 of the manual to learn the power that ZSDOS can 
bring to 8-bit computers.  Learn to use the tools provided with 
the ZSDOS distribution package to customize the Operating System 
to your own requirements and desires.  All tools listed below 
operate equally well under ZSDOS and ZDDOS unless specifically 
noted.  Briefly, the tools are:


     COPY - Copy single or groups of files between disk drives 
and/or user areas preserving date/time stamps (Modification of 
ZCPR tool MCOPY).  (4.1)

     DATSWEEP  (ZDDOS or ZSDOS with DateStamper only) - 
Plu*Perfect's full-featured screen-oriented disk and file utility 
(4.2).

     FILEATTR - Display/Set attributes of individual or groups of 
files.  (4.3)

     FILEDATE (ZDDOS or ZSDOS with DateStamper only) - Full fea
tured Disk directory lister that permits elaborate selective 
listing based on DateStamper-style Date/Time files.  (4.4)

     INITDIR - Initialize a disk directory for P2DOS (CP/M Plus) 
type Date/Time Stamping.  (3.2.5)

     PUTDS - Initialize a disk for DateStamper type Date/Time 
Stamping (licensed Plu*Perfect utility).  (3.2.4)

     RELOG - Resets Hard Disk Login vectors.  Primarily for use 
in more elaborate Hard Disk systems which swap logical Hard 
Drives, or use removeable-media, but are defined as Fixed Drives.  
(4.5)

     TD - Display/Set an installed clock via ZSDOS/ZDDOS.  (4.6)

     ZCAL - Display a brief calendar of current or any desired 
month.  (4.7)

     ZCNFG - Configuration utility to set defaults, such as US or 
European date displays, in COPY, FILEATTR, FILEDATE, TD, and ZXD.

     ZPATH (ZSDOS only) - Permits setting the Internal DOS path 
as well as a ZCPR3 path (Modification of ZCPR tool PATH).  (4.9)

     ZSCONFIG - Basic configuration program for both ZSDOS and 
ZDDOS.  Operates in both interactive and command-line driven 
modes wih the latter being ideal for customizing the System from 
a STARTUP file under ZCPR3 environments.  Options vary between 
ZSDOS and ZDDOS.  (4.10)

     ZXD - Directory lister for DateStamper and/or P2DOS (CP/M 
Plus) Date/Time stamping methods (Extensive modification of ZCPR 
tool XD III).  (4.11)
