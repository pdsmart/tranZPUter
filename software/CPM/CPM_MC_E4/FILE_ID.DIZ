DX-Forth - Forth compiler for CP/M-80
-------------------------------------

DX-Forth is a Forth language compiler/development system
for CP/M-80 and compatible operating systems.

It is intended to be a complete, easy to use, programming
tool for the creation of CP/M applications.

DX-Forth's features include:

 - Forth-94 Standard *
 - Fast direct-threaded code
 - Generate turnkey applications without compiler overhead
 - Video terminal functions, installable for most terminals
 - Fast floating point
 - Forth-94 Standard disk I/O
 - DU: style filenames for access to all CP/M user areas
 - Z-System (ZCPR) support through ZENV function
 - Program error return code for CP/M-3 and Z-System
 - Multitasking
 - Overlays for large applications
 - 8080/Z80 Forth assembler for CODE words
 - Load screen or text files nested to 6 levels
 - Full source code included

* DX-Forth currently lacks appropriate documentation to
  qualify for Forth-94 compliance.  Some optional wordset
  functions may also be missing.
