        INTRODUCTION


                                  Introduction

             This  program  was developed so that developement  could  be 
        performed  on a small computer utilizing CP/M for large IBM site.  
        The  data or programs were coded using the  small  computer,  and 
        then  transfered  to  the IBM computer  utilizing  this  program.  
        Also,  certain  data were transferred back to the small  computer 
        for  updating  and  again transferred back to the  IBM  computer.  
        Thus,  the time involved for coding and keypunching were absorbed 
        on the small machine.   All transfers were performed by diskette.
             This  manual assumes that the reader has a working knowledge 
        of both CP/M and IBM operating systems.   In particular, the user 
        should  fully understand the basic disk layout for  IBM  Standard 
        Interchange Format.   This program assumes the SIF throughout and 
        was  written to be compatible with only it.   NO other IBM format 
        is  utilized.   For further information concerning  this  format, 
        please review manual GA21-9182, IBM General Information Manual on 
        Diskettes.
             The  program was designed to be menu driven with  prompting.  
        Currently,  each  response  is verified,  and if  incorrect,  re-
        prompted.   If you make a mistake which is a valid reply, re-boot 
        CP/M and restart the program.   At this time,  no backup facility 
        is offered so be careful as to your responses.
             When working with CP/M files,  the file names are assumed to 
        be  an  1-8 byte name with a type of '.DAT'.   The 1-8 byte  name 
        must correspond with a file name on the IBM diskette.



        INITIALIZE AN IBM DISKETTE


                           Initialize an IBM Diskette

             To  initialize  a  diskette in  IBM  SIF  format,  use  this 
        command.  Place the diskette to be initialized in the appropriate 
        drive.   Select  this function (1).   Reply with the drive (A-D).  
        Then reply with the new 6-byte volume serial number.  The program 
        will  then format the diskette to IBM specifications.   This  may 
        take  a  few minutes so don't be alarmed if it doesn't  reply  to 
        you immediately.   After initialization, the diskette is ready to 
        use as an IBM diskette.



        CHANGE AN IBM VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER


                       Change an IBM Volume Serial Number

             This  function  allows  the user to  simply  change  an  IBM 
        diskette's volume serial number.  Use function code (2) to invoke 
        it.  Reply with the disk drive (A-D) that the diskette is on, and 
        then reply with the new volume serial number, 1-6 characters.  No 
        checking  is done on the rest of the diskette.   Only the  volume 
        serial number is changed.



        CHANGE AN IBM DATASET'S DIRECTORY ENTRY


                     Change an IBM Dataset's Directory Entry

             This  function allows you to change the directory entry  for 
        an IBM file.   You will use this entry to create a  file,  rename 
        it or adjust its parameters.   To invoke this function,  use code 
        (3).   Reply  with  the disk drive containing the  IBM  diskette.  
        Then reply with the directory sector to be changed.  You can find 
        the  sector number by using function (6),  List  Directory.   The 
        program will then display all the fields in the entry and request 
        that you entry a new value.   Enter ONLY the fields that you want 
        to change.   When the last field has been entered,  the directory 
        will  automatically be updated,  and a completion message will be 
        posted to the terminal.  You will then return to the main menu.



        DELETE AN IBM DATASET'S DIRECTORY ENTRY


        Delete an IBM Dataset's Directory Entry

             To delete a dataset from an IBM diskette, place the diskette 
        in a drive,  invoke function code (4), enter the disk drive (A-D) 
        on which the diskette resides, and enter the sector number of the 
        directory  entry.   If you are in doubt as to the sector  number, 
        use function code (6),  List Directory,  to find out what it  is.  
        When the entry has been deleted and a completion message has been 
        posted, control will return to the main menu.

        TRANSFER AN IBM FILE TO CP/M FORMAT (BLOCK)
        TRANSFER A CP/M FILE TO IBM FORMAT (SOURCE)
