	PRETTY is a program for capitalizing reserved words in a pascal
source file. I normally type everthing in in lower case.

	I hope to eventually make this the basis of a complete
'pretty-printing' program which will indent properly etc. If anyone
has one, I would love to hear of it.

	Basically the program searches through the source file looking
for reserved words and capitalizing them. It writes them out to a file
with the same name but with a 'type' of TMP. Thus, to operate on a
Pascal MT+ source file called DUMMY.SRC, you would just type:

	PRETTY DUMMY

The program would operate on DUMMY.SRC and would write DUMMY.TMP.
