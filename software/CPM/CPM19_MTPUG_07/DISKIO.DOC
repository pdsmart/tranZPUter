	This file is the start of a library of I/O routines. The only
one implemented to date is the procedure 'GETARG'.

	GETARG is a procedure for getting command line arguments. For
example, if it were used in a program called DUMMY, then invoking the
program by typing:

	DUMMY NAME1 NAME2

will result in the procedure getarg returning NAME1 and NAME2. It also
returns the number of arguments ( up to 2).

	For example, in the above case, the number returned would be 2.
If the command line were:

	DUMMY NAME

the procedure would return a number of 1 and it would be NAME.

	Finally, typing in a command line which caontains more than
two arguments causes getarg to return a number of 2 and the second
returned string would contain all the succeeding arguments. Thus,
if the command line were:

	DUMMY NAME1 NAME2 NAME3 NAME4

it would return NAME1 as the first string and NAME2 NAME3 NAME4 as the
second.

	The source code could, of course, be modified to separate out
more than two arguments.

	I first saw the technique used in this procedure in an article
in S-100 Microsystems by two Gilbreath's.
