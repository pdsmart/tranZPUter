     .COM     by the Digital Research's MAC assembler.  Has improved
     .DOC     output format.

GRAPH.DOC     This set of programs was the result of a concerted 
GRPH.SRC      effort to produce a PORTABLE set of graphic procedures
GRAPHADM.SRC  which could be easily used on more than one machine.
              Written by J.A. Koehler and Jack Gilmer.

SHAREFIL.DOC  This is an application program using a Pascal interface
              to assembly modules provided by Sue Arnold of Centaurus
              Software. These modules together provide file sharing
              and record locking/unlocking capability for Pascal/MT+
              programs ver 5.5 running under MP/M II. This package of
              programs is not supported by the author or by Digital
              Research, Inc.

              routines. Written by Dick Lovelace and Dan Erickson.

BCD.DOC       Z80 Version of BCDREALS.ERL(Ver 5.5). This module is
   .ERL       about 20% shorter and 25% faster than the original
              library.  It is highly Z-80 specific. Provided by
              Guenter Musstopf, author unknown.

TYPESET.DOC   Program converts a text file written by "WORDSTAR"
       .SRC   to a format acceptable to type setting equipment.
       .PRM   Special Wordstar symbols are translated to symbols
              acceptable to the type setting equipment. Operator
              intervention requested when needed. May also be
              used to translate to other word processor formats.
