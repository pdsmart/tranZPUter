	PRMAC is a program for typing out the .PRN and .SYM files
produced by Digital Research's MAC assembler. The only difference
between this and the one in the manual for MAC (other than the
fact that theirs is in assembly language) is that it paginates
the output etc.

	It is invoked by typing:

	PRMAC DUMMY LISTING

where DUMMY is the basename of the file to be listed and
where LISTING is the name of the desired output file - usually this
is just the listing 'device' - LST:

The program will then read through DUMMY.PRN, send it to the output
file, and then do the same for DUMMY.SYM.

NOTE *******

	After doing the above, the program will ERASE both the source
files!
