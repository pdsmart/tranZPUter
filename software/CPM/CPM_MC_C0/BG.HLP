KEYS <CR>

    Select from the menu:
	  D - Define a key
	  P - Paste last-cut region to key
	  R - begin Recording keystrokes
	  V - View current definitions
	  K - view single Key
	  S - Save current definitions to file
	  L - Load (previously-saved) key definitions
	  A - Attach definitions to program for auto-loading


		Defining a key.

To define a numeric keypad key, first press that key,
then enter keystrokes and terminate with the <SUSPEND> key.

To define a main keyboard key, first press the <ALT> key, followed
by the key to be defined, e.g. "\a".

To erase a character, type <DEL>, or control-X to start over.

To enter hex characters, first type the '#' key.

To enter a special character literally (Quote it), first type control-Q.

If there is no screendriver, define the "r" key to be a screen-redraw
string appropriate to the running task.


		Pasting to a key.
		(requires a loaded screendriver)

The Paste option uses the last-cut region to define a key. A
carriage-return (^M) is added to the end of each row.  Edit as desired,
and terminate with <SUSPEND>.

		Viewing definitions.

Use the View option to inspect the currently defined keys. The display
starts and ends with a colon ':' in order to indicate any spaces
included in the definition.

To view a single defined key, use the K option.

		Keystroke Recording.

Use the Record option to begin recording each keystroke. 

Recording is terminated by typing the previously-defined <RECORD>
key, or the <SUSPEND> key.  Up to 255 keystrokes may be recorded.

		Saving definitions.

Definitions may be saved for re-use when re-running a program. The Save
option requests a short descriptive label and a filename. Usually, it's
convenient to use the name of the current program. The filetype is
automatically set to ".BG ".


		Loading definitions.

Definitions may be (manually) loaded by selecting the Load option and
entering the filename of the definitions to use.  The newly- loaded
definitions replace any previously loaded or defined strings.

Definitions can be automatically loaded whenever a particular program is
run.  To use this feature, Save the desired definitions to a suitable
filename.  Then select the Attach option, give the name of the program,
and the name of the definitions file.  The next time the program is run
these definitions will automatically be installed.

	       Global and user-task definitions

When BGii is first loaded, it contains a short list of global
definitions, which you can inspect by typing KEYS and then V.  GLOBAL
definitions are available everywhere -- in Foreground and Background
CP/M and in either user task.  You can add new definitions, save them,
load others, etc. by using the KEYS command at Foreground CP/M level.

USER-TASK definitions are reserved for an active user task. To define
keys for a particular program, once it is running, type <SUSPEND>, KEYS
and D.  These definitions are in effect only while this task is active,
not in Background CP/M and not in another task.  They expire when the
program is exited, so if you want to preserve them you should <SUSPEND>,
use KEYS and the Save command.  To cause them to be automatically loaded
with the next use of that program, use the Attach command also.

If you use the same key for a user-task definition and a global
definition, the user-task definition takes precedence while the task is
active.  The global definition remains in hiding and takes effect
everywhere else.
