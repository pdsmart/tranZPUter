This version of NSB is for use with the Zenith Z-19/Heath H-19 terminals.
The SB_GETCH function has been modified to intercept the Escape sequence
commands so that the 18 keypad & special function keys can be used. All
original commands still function as before, except that the ERASE key is
now the escape (ESC) key. The ESC key still functions but must be pushed
twice in succession to obtain an escape.
