CALCAL/SRC            Convert dates from the MMDDYY year format to
                      an integer which increases by one for each
                      day.  Corrects for leap year and includes
                      an example.  By Ed. Reed.

VARIO/SRC             A self modifying program which can be used
                      to read/write multiple random files with
                      differing record sizes. By Ed. Reed.

DIRFILE/SRC/ERL       This program reads the disk directory and
                      writes it to a file.  Useful for backup
                      purposes and with modification within
                      a program.  By Ed. Reed.

EPSON/DOC             This program allows the formatting characters
EPSON/SRC/ERL         used by the EPSON printer to be passed to it
EPSON2/SRC/ERL        without requiring the user to commit the codes
                      to memory.  The program interacts with the user
                      to print a formatted text file using different
                      spacing, fonts, etc.  By Harry Eckerson.

CMPXLIB/DOC/SRC       Complex math library for Pascal.  This library
                      uses pointer variables so that functions rather
                      than functions may be used.  By Ron Finger.

MATHLIB/DOC           The Mathlib function library has been split
POWRLIB/SRC           and now includes range checking, a new trig
TRIGLIB/SRC           function ATAN2 has been added.  This is the
STATLIB/SRC           arctangent function with quadrant recognition
FNC9511/SRC           (like Fortran).  The Statlib uses the
                      conformant array schema for passing arrays of
                      differing upper and lower bounds. The procedures
                      find the MIN, MAX, MEAN(average) and standard
                      deviation(Sigma) of the array passed.
                      The FNC9511 library is the MT+ TRAN9511 library
                      with additional range checking.  The functions
                      TAN, ASIN, ACOS, ALOG10, AND PI have been
                      added.

NSB/DOC/SRC           Modified for use with Zenith Z-19/Heath H-19
                      terminals. SB_GETCH has been modified to 
                      intercept the Escape sequence commands so that
                      the 18 keypad & special function keys can be
                      used. By Ron Finger.

NSBCUR19/DOC/SRC      Modified for use with Zenith Z-19/Heath H-19
                      terminals. Both the function and cursor keys
                      on the terminal are used.  This version works
                      with 4 MHz systems and instructions are
                      included for converting the code on a 2 MHz
                      system. By Jerry Jankura.

ACOUSTIC/PAS          A set of routines designed to emulate a 
                      D.C.Hayes modem with an acoustic coupler)
                      (Can be used by TERMINAL instead of DCMODEM
                       By Warren Smith

CIRQUE/PAS            A set of routines to mainuplate a circular que
                      By Warren Smith
 
CRT/PAS               A set of routines for manipulating a cursor
                      addressable CRT (Used by TERMINAL and RINGING)

                      By Warren Smith

DCMODEM/PAS           A set of routines to access the features of a
                      D.C.Hayes S-100 modem (Used by TERMINAL and
                      RINGING) By Warren Smith

RINGING/PAS/CMD       A program to let your computer tell you that
                      your phone is ringing. By Warren Smith

TERMINAL/PAS/CMD      A program to act as a dumb terminal, can also
                      display control characters coming in on the line.
                      By Warren Smith

UTILITY/PAS           Only has one routine, a lower to upper case
                      translating. By Warren Smith
