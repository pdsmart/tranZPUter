The earlier MATHLIB math function library has been split into POWRLIB and
TRIGLIB. The functions now include range checking, and a new trig function,
ATAN2 has been added. This is the arctangent function with quadrant
recognition. It works like the FORTRAN function of the same name.

The new CMPXLIB library uses the pointer variable technique, now so that
functions instead of procedures may be used.

The STATLIB library uses the conformant array schema for passing arrays of
different upper and lower bounds. The procedures find the minimum, maximum,
mean (average), and standard deviation (sigma) of the conformant arrays passed.

The FNC9511 library is the MT+ TRAN9511 library with additional range checking.
The 9511 chip functions, TAN, ASIN, ACOS, LOG10, AND PI functions have been
added.
