             This  utility program comes in usefull to those people 
     who wish to display/print a text file of indeterminate  origin 
     and  character.   It  may be used to display files  that  were 
     collected  by  the  use of MODEM7 or even WORD STAR  when  one 
     wishes to study files generated by these and other systems.


       Command formats :

     to CON:                : CTYPE ufn.typ
     to LST:                : CTYPE ufn.typ P
     to LST: no header      : CTYPE ufn.typ PN


     The following is a list of services offerd by CTYPE


     1)     Strip high order bit off every character.
              ( eg. bit 8 alwas 0 )


     2)     Ignores all end of file ( ^Z ) characters in the file.
              ( It may not be pretty at the end of file but
                 at least you never lose any data from a premature
                 EOF )


     3)     Carriage return and line feed when uesd separately
              will force the corresponding member of the pair.
             ( This disallows overprinting of text in file )


     4)     The form feed token (^L) is always followed by a
            carriage return line feed, which insures clarity
            when listing certain types of text files.


     5)     Display/print most CONTROL characters in token form.


     CONTROL codes in TOKEN form by HEX values :

     00-@   08-H    10-P    18-X    5E-! = ^
     01-A   09-I    11-Q    19-Y    7F-# = DEL/RUB
     02-B   0A-J    12-R    1A-Z
     03-C   0B-K    13-S    1B-[
     04-D   0C-L    14-T    1C-\
     05-E   0D-M    15-U    1D-]
     06-F   0E-N    16-V    1E-^
     07-G   0F-O    17-W    1F-_
