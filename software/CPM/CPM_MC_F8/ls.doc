  	The program lists the directory in several different	 
  	formats depending on switches set in the command	 
  	line (ala C).	Explanation of the switches follows:	 
  								 
  	Size specification:					 
  		-f	Lists full directory (file size in	 
  			records, size file takes in disk	 
  			space, and the files attributes		 
  		-b	Lists brief directory (file size in	 
  			records only				 
  	   default	Lists file names only			 
  	Attribute specification:				 
  		-n	Lists files that are SYS only	 	 
  		-r	Lists files that are R/O only		 
  		-w	Lists files that are R/W only		 
  		-a	Lists files regardless of attributes	 
  	   default	Lists files that are DIR only		 
  			(corresponds to CP/M dir)		 
  	Sort specification:					 
  		-s	Sorts listed files alphabettically	 
  	   default	Does not sort files			 
  	Case specification:					 
  		-u	Lists information in upper case		 
  	   default	Lists information in lower case		 
  								 
  	For the size or attributes specifications - if two	 
  	of any switches in either of these groups are set -	 
  	a conflict arises and a warning is issued and the   	 
  	default setting for the group is set.			 
  	e.g. ls  .com -fb	This command asks for a full	 
  	and a brief listing at the same time.  Here warning	 
  	is issued and default set (brief, brief listing)	 
  	Switches may be set in any order and can be con-	 
  	catenated or separated.					 
  	e.g. ls *.com -fasl does the same as
  	ls *.com -a -s -fl
