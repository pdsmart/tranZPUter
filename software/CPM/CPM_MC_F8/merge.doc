
      FILE MERGER  [MERGE]  by Bjorn Beskow

      Merge will merge two sorted textfiles together into one.

      The syntax is:-

                MERGE [d:]Source1 [d:]Source2 [[d:]DESTINATION]

      MERGE will merge Source1 with Source2 into DESTINATION.
      If destination is omitted, MERGE will use Source1 as destination.

      Example:
                MERGE file1 file2

      will merge file1 with file2 into file1.
      
      If you have to merge a small file with a big one (for example, NEW.LEX
      with MASTER.LEX), this routine will be mutch faster than copying the
      files together and then sort the result. First, sort new.lex, then merge
      them together.
