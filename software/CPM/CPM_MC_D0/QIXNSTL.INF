TERMINAL INSTALLATION

Before you use this program, it must be installed to your particular  
terminal, i.e. provided with information regarding control characters 
required for certain functions such as cursor control, screen clear, 
etc.  This installation is easily performed using the program contained 
in TURBOINS.LBR available elsewhere on this system

The install program will give a menu listing a number of popular 
terminals will appear, inviting you to choose one by entering its 
number.  If your terminal is not amoung those offered, enter the number 
corresponding to "None of the above" and answer the questions one by 
one as they appear on the screen.

As the questions are asked, you may find some that your terminal may 
not support.  If so, just pass the command not needed by typing RETURN 
in response to the prompt.  If Delete line, Insert line, or Erase to 
end of line is not installed, these functions will be emulated in 
software, slowing screen performance somewhat.

Commands may be entered either simply by pressing the appropriate keys  
or by entering the decimal or hexadecimal ASCII value of the command.  
If a command requires the two characters 'ESCAPE' and '=', may:

either 
	Press first the Esc key, then the =.  The entry will be
        echoed with appropriate labels, i.e. <ESC> =.

or      Enter the decimal or hexadecimal values separated by
        spaces.  Hexadecimal values must be preceded by a dollar-
        sign.  Enter e.g. 27 61 or $1B 61 or $1B $3D which are
        all equivalent.

The two methods cannot be mixed, i.e. once you have entered a non-
numeric character, the rest of that command must be defined in
that mode, and vise versa.

A hyphen entered as the very first character is used to delete  a
command, and echoes the text Nothing.
