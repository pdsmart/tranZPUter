There are (currently) three implementations of QIX for CP/M computers:
a VT100 version (QIXVT100.ARK), a Morrow  MDT-60  version (QIXMORRW.ARK),
and a "generic" version (QIXGENER.ARK).  The source code files, written
in Turbo Pascal, are found in QIX-SRC.ARK.

If you don't have a graphics set on your terminal, I suggest you look at
the "generic" version; it uses only the standard  ASCII characters to do
drawing and should work with any CP/M computer terminal that supports
cursor addressing.

	Good luck!
