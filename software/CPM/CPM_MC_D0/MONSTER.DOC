                               INSTRUCTIONS FOR
                                MONSTER COMBAT
       In the game of MONSTER COMBAT, you attempt to win treasure from various
loathsome  creatures  and leave the forest with as much treasure as possible -
without getting killed in the process!   At the beginning, you are placed at a
randomly chosen location in a forest with a certain number of combat  strength
points.   As you move through the forest, you will encounter monsters guarding
various tempting treasures.    At  each  meeting  you  are  given  a choice of
fighting the monster, running from it, or bribing it.  If you  wish  to  fight
you will be asked to enter the number of combat points you wish to use.  Enter
any number smaller than your present strength. Each monster has its own combat
strength. These are as follows:

    MINOTAUR    10         CYCLOPS         20         ZOMBIE         30
    GIANT       40         HARPY           50         GRIFFIN        60
    CHIMERA     70         DRAGON          80         WYVERN         90
    BASLISK     100

       If  you enter a number equal to the monsters strength, you have a 50-50
chance of defeating it.   Entering  a  higher number increases your chances of
winning, while entering a smaller number lowers that chance.   No  matter  how
much  strength you use, there is a 1 in 1000 chance that the monster will kill
you anyway !  Also, the more treasure  you have, the more strength you need to
use to achieve the same odds against the monster in combat.  If you choose  to
run, your chances of getting away from a monster successively decrease as each
new monster's strength increases.  Thus you are more likely to get away from a
minotaur  than from a baslisk.  If you succeed in running away, you are placed
in a new randomly selected  square.    Not  getting  away usually results in a
battle. Occasionally, while you are running, the monster will catch you -  one
of  the risks of chickening out.  Of course trying to bribe your foe is an age
old alternative to running or fighting.    For this, you must use the treasure
you have won. Whether or not you succeed depends on the value of the  treasure
the  monster  is  guarding.    The  more  its  value, the more you must pay to
successfully bribe your adversary.  If the bribe fails, prepare to fight. 

Treasure values are:
    TEN SILVER SPOONS        10       JEWELED SWORD            30
    JAR OF RUBIES            50       FIFTY SILVER COINS       50
    BOX OF JEWELS            75       100 GOLD PEICES          100

    Movement through the forest is easy:  just enter the direction you wish to
go - N for North, SE for South East, etc.  The option to reset the display  is
included  (  press  1  ) in case the previous play of the game caused too many
lines of text to be printed below the  map.  The map will be reprinted and the
display cleared.  Your position will be displayed on the map, as well  as  the
location  of  trees  in  the forest.  You must go around the trees.  To leave,
simply move to any blank area adjacent to  the edge of the map.  Scores of 500
to 700 are average.  Anything above 1000 is excellent.  As is common to  games
of  this  type,  I have left out a number of things that you will have to find
out for yourself (I've got to  have  some  fun, after all). Good luck and good
hunting !
