Version 31 corrects a bug in version 30 (and probably all versions back to 25)
that prevented LT from accepting USER specifications as a SOURCE of data.
(Many thanks to Roger Warren, Sysop, Elephant's Graveyard San Diego,
California for the suggestions for fixing this problem.)

Version 31 also changed the 6 labels in the MAC file, which had 7 characters to
6 character labels.  That was done to make LT31.MAC compatible with an ancient
(about 1979) version of M80 that will not accept labels with more than 6
characters.  This change does not in any way impair the use of LT31.MAC with
any other assembler.

Version 30 (July '91) incorporated Version 2.0 of LZH Encoding.  Excellent for
TYPE.COM use.  Can type normal, LZH-encoded, crunched or squeezed files -
whether standalone or in a .LBR.  If wheel is on, can also easily extract
any/all files, and uncrunch and/or unsqueeze at the same time.	Most useful
program for either RCP/M use or for individual CP/M systems.
