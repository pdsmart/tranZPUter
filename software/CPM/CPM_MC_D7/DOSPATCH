A patch for cpm2.2 for submit jobs to execute while changing
user numbers.  This co-operates with CCP+ v2.1 and JOB v1.5.

All values are shown for an unrelocated BDOS.  marked bytes
may be different by a constant

Location
(from start
of BDOS)	Was	Becomes	Comment
06DE		3e	7e	mvi a,0e5 --> mov a,m
06DF		e5	fe
06E0		be	e5	cmp m 	  --> cpi 0e5
06E1		ca
06E2		d2		  jz ...   unchanged
06E3		06 *
06E4		3a	18	lda usrno --> jr $+3
06E5		41	01
06E6		03 *		(code byte skipped)
06E7		be	b7	cmp m     --> ora a
		
The WAS items marked by '*' will vary with the location of
the CPM system, and should not be altered.  The patch uses
the Z80 JR instruction, so for Z80 systems only.  This has
been carefully designed to be position independant.

When completed, the original CCP will no longer execute
SUBMIT jobs when the user number is non-zero. It would never
allow a submit job to change users, which can now be done
when using CCP+ and JOB15.  (earlier versions of JOB will
work if the job is started on user 0 only.)

This causes BDOS to return 0ffh for call 13 (reset disks)
whenever a '$*.*' file exists on user 0.  This flag is
used by CCP+, ZCPR, and the original CCP to decide whether
to bother searching for the $$$.SUB file.  The original
code only returned 0ffh when the file existed on the current
user.
