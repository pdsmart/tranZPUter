
USAGE:

z80dis filename.drives /options

The drive codes are used in the .typ portion of the filespec.
	1) the first drive code is the location of the source file
	   (must be a .COM file)
	2) the second code is where the program should look for a .SYM
	   file.  Some legal drive must be specified even if the .SYM
	   file doesn't exist.
	3) the third code is optional and is the target drive for the
	   the output files.

EXAMPLE:

z80dis dump.abc

	looks for DUMP.COM on drive A:, DUMP.SYM on B:, and outputs to C:

The option list is preceeded by a single slash /.  Valid options are:
	c	send output to console
	l	send output to printer
	x	output cross reference (.XRF) only


.SYM FILE FORMAT

	%st	start address (default 100H)
	%of	offset address (default 0)
	%en	end address
	%ax	enable alphabetized cross reference
	%ls	full listing
	%db aaaa-bbbb  define bytes from address aaaa to bbbb inclusive
