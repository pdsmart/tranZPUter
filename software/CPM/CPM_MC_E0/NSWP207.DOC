Notes on NSWP 204
-----------------

NSWP 204 has a few new features! First, limited CPM 3 has been established,
in that if you have BDOS version over 3.0 (which may include MPM), you may
now run with ALV banked. NSWP will use the BDOS call to obtain the ALV
information. This also applies to the 16 bit version.

Before 204, if you attempted to delete a file that was currently tagged,
it was not removed from the tagged file size. It is correctly handled in all
cases now.

NSWP now saves the SP, rather than (SP), in order to support totally non-
standard implementations of BDOS and CCP.

When using the '?' function, the current disk information, along with the
tagged file size.

The copy file speed has been further optimized by elimination of a redundant
BDOS call (deleting a file, when we know it ain't there!).

NSWP has been modified to better support MPM and MPM86 by doing a rename
after a copy operation. This will drop the copy speed slightly, nullifying
the effect of the above change.

If you find anything else, please drop me a line...

Notes on NSWP 205
-----------------

NSWP 204 introduced a bug that would not allow you to copy a file if
that file was set to R/O, unless you had a destination that was ALSO
R/O!


Notes on NSWP 206
-----------------

NSWP 206 has further CPM 3 features, such as using the display-and-return
error mode. As well, NSWP now fully implements the $$$ copy file techinque,
for both regular and SQ/USQ file copy operations. This will permit the use
of 'PUBLIC' BDOS patches, and full use under MPM, as well as concurrent CPM
86. You may now log directly to a drive/user from the CCP, by using
the syntax NSWP A4:*.*, or more simply NSWP A4 . NSWP now uses the same
routine for CCP logon, as it does for the LOG command within NSWP. If you
have selected a group of files (*.QQZ, for example), this information is
displayed at logon.

NSWP 207
--------

NSWP 207 has the last of the CPM 3 features, and concurrent as well, this
being the multisector IO feature. This speeds file transfers under these
operating systems by at LEAST 1.5 times, and it even handles physical IO
errors whilst doing this. Also, the copy command has been alterted so that
if you copy to a DIFFERENT drive, the disk system is reset. This will permit
fast copies to the same diskette, and the ability to freely change the
destination disk!
