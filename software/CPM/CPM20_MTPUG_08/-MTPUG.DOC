Here  is a package of information on how I have implemented real-
time multi-tasking under MP/M-86 using Pascal MT+86.  I am not in 
a position to provide detailed tutorials free to anyone who asks, 
nor  to  field general questions from users.   But I am  glad  to 
share this with the MT Plus User's Group.   The package  consists 
of the following:

MPMUTIL.DOC    Documentation
MPMUTIL.I86    Source code for use with the ASMT86  assembler
MPMUTIL.R86    Assembled  version of the above
MPMTTIME.SRC   Pascal  source  code illustrating  the  added
               timing function
MPMTEST.SRC    Pascal  source  code illustrating the use  of
               multi-tasking with the MPMUTIL package
MPMTESTQ.SRC   Pascal  source code illustrating the  use  of
               MP/M message queues to synchronize tasks

PASMAT.DOC     A Wordstar format user's manual for Pasmat.
      .CMD     CP/M-86 Version
      .COM     CP/M-80 Version.  Either version works on
               MT+80 or MT+86 source code.
PMTEST.TST     A scrambled Pascal program which tests MT+ features.
PMXREF.TST     A Pascal program which kills the MT+ XREF program.

DMP.SRC        The graphical module
SERIO.SRC      The I/O module which communicates with the
               plotter.
CHROFF.DAT     Data needed to plot the character set
CHRVE.DAT      So far, upper case only.
TESTGR.SRC     A test program to exercise the plotter.
WRDATA.SRC     The program used to generate the .DAT files above.

ELEVATOR.PAS   An elevator simulation program written by someone
        .DOC   in school taking a computer course.  Program shows
        .DAT   how to get around a MT+ Bug involving calls to the
               floating point routines with explicit reference to
               the predeclared input files INPUT and OUTPUT.  
               There are three elevators in a 15 story building,
               and this program simulates the pushing of the buttons
               in the cars or on the floors.  Submitted by
