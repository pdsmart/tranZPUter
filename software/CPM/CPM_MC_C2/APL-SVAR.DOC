Shared Variable System Functions
(taken from IBM VS APL Reference Summary #SX26-3712-6)

Descriptive Name/        Result
General Form

access control query     Access control vector for the shared
quad SVCy                variable named y.

set access control       Access control vector for shared
x quad SVCy              variable y is set based on x. New
                         access control vector is displayed.

incoming offer query     A matrix of variable names offered
quad SVQy                by any of the processors named in y.
                         If y is empty, the result is a vector 
                         of processor numbers making unmatched
                         offers.

outgoing offer query     A matrix of variable names offered
x quad SVQy              to y having a degree of coupling of
                         x. If y is empty, the result is a
                         vector of processor numbers offered
                         variables with that degree of
                         coupling.

shared variable offer    Variable named y is offered for
x quad SVOy              sharing with processor x. Resulting
                         degree of coupling is returned.

shared variable          Offer of variable named y is retracted.
retraction               Degree of coupling of y before
quad SVRy                retraction is returned.

shared variable status   Degree of coupling of variable named
quad SVOy                y is returned.
