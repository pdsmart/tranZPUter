150K of code. Sorry.

procref/src     A simple minded tool which will show you all
       /erl     the nested procedure/function calls in a
       /com     program.  This is a two pass program, the
       /doc     second of which prints each line containing of 
                the saved names anywhere in the line, including
                inside comments. Uses two modules included
                g2txt which removes two file names from an
                input string and opens the first as a text file
                and the second as an output text file.  The 
                second is cpmname which checks a name for validity.

Z19/H89/asm     A collection of modules for direct cursor addressing
       /rel     the Zenith Z19 or the Heath H89 terminals.  This
Z19LIB/erl      group of 26 programs is collected into a library.
External/doc    English explanation of each module.
loewner/doc     German explanation of each module.
                Programs are compiled with the M80/L80 assembler.
                (Z80 code, I think). Written by Juergen Loewner.
