1.0  Baselines

     The  following baseline software is established by this  up
grade:

          SYSLIB Version 2.7
               Error in SDIR Module Corrected
               SEPRINT and SEPSTR Modules Added

          ECHO Version 1.2


2.0  Associated Upgrade Documentation

     SYSLIB.HLP  has  been  modified to describe the  EPRINT  and 
EPSTR routines.

4.0  Reasons for Changes to Programs and Files

     A bug was detected and corrected in the SDIR  module.   This 
bug was in the DIRLOAD routine.

     A  need  was realized for Exact Print capability in  SYSLIB.  
The  routines  PRINT,   LPRINT,  PSTR,  and  LPSTR  performed  an 
interpretation on control characters,  printing these  characters 
as  two-character sequences of the form "^c".   EPRINT and  EPSTR 
have been added to SYSLIB,  and,  aside from expanding tabs, they 
perform  no  other  translation on control characters  output  by 
them.   Consequently,  they  can  be used to  issue  commands  to 
intelligent   terminals   and  the  like  which  require   escape 
sequences.

     The  online  documentation  in  SYSLIB.HLP  was  updated  to 
describe EPRINT and EPSTR.   Documentation in the SYSLIB  manuals 
will be updated at a later time.

     The  SYSTEST2  program was expanded to allow  more  complete 
testing of the DIRF and DIRFS routines in SYSLIB.

     The  ECHO command was changed to use EPSTR so that ECHO  can 
now  be used to send commands to the CRT control commands.   This 
extends its utility by permitting it to be used to initialize the 
CRT on STARTUP or in ST applications.

5.0  Impact on ZCPR2

     No impact is expected on any of the ZCPR2 utilities,  except 
for ECHO.  No other changes are issued.

6.0  New Documentation

     The SYSLIB.HLP file and this MOD file are to provide interim 
documentation until the new SYSLIB manuals are released.
