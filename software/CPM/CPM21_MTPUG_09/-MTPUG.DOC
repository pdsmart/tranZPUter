         Version 2.2 Serial #12200012

     The entire source was submitted to MTPUG for
distribution as Public Domain Software and can not
be sold.  A version (improved ??) which is supported can be
purchased from the Author, Lawrence Adkins,

TYPECHK.DOC   This program detects errors in Pascal/MT+
       .SUB   source modules which are apparent only when
       .COM   comparing the common identifier declarations
              made in them.  This is a very large program
              which is comprised of 9 modules and about
              4300 lines of .PRN output.  It requires about
              30 minutes to compile and about 35 min to
              check itself.  Source code, .ERL and .COM files
              requires about 200K of space. Extensive features
              are available for directing output to a file as
              well as to the terminal.

PASERROR.SRC  The MT+ error messages are printed on the terminal
              when given the error number.

MSA326 .DOC   These programs were transcribed from hard copy
MSA326A.PAS   listings.  They are numerical analysis programs
MSA326B.PAS   from a book by Conte and Deboore, Title and Publisher
MSA326C.PAS   are unknown.

PLANE.SRC     This is a Pascal upgrade of a Basic program from one 
              of the early CP/M Library disks.  The conversion was
              done by Dan Covill, a San Diego software consultant,
              who is happy to have it added to your program disks.
              The graphics is currently configured to run on a
              Heath H-19 Terminal, but can be easily changed.  I 
              trust you will find it a pleasant distraction from 
              the serious programs.  Submitted by Wil Wakely,
              2328 Germanium Street, San Diego, CA 92109

SWEEP.COM     This is a new improved version of a program which
              appeared on program disk #4.  Written by Robert
              Fisher in PL/1.  This version includes verified
              copy. Used for tagged multi-file copy or delete.
              On some systems, the automatic disk reset allows
              multi-disk operations. An improved assembly version
              is available from Micro Resources, 2468 Hansen Court,
              Simi Valley, CA 93605 for $49.95

SYNONYM.COM   This small program allows you to create your own
              collection of synanyms for activating programs.
