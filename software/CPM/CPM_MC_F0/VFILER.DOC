			VFILER 1.7 by Richard Conn

	VFILER is a screen-oriented file manipulation utility.  Following 
in the footsteps of SWEEP, CLEAN, and DISK, VFILER performs the same 
fundamental functions, but adds screen-oriented displays and manipulation 
to it, giving a more user-friendly interface in my opinion.

	VFILER must be installed for a user's terminal.  To do this, edit 
VFILERSC.ASM, follow the directions contained therein, and set up this 
file to support your CRT's Clear Screen, Goto XY, and Clear To End Of Line 
functions.  Once done, assemble VFILERSC, patch it into VFILER by using 
DDT (I and R commands, with no offset for R), and then save the result. 
VFILER now is installed to run under CP/M.

	This version of VFILER is already installed for a Bigboard. This 
means that it will run without modification on the Kaypro and Xerox 820 
also. It is set to allow a 4 drive system (A-D).

	If the user is running ZCPR2, he should now run GENINS on VFILER, 
do a normal installation, and write out the result.  VFILER will take 
advantage of the special features of ZCPR2 if so installed.

	When VFILER is invoked, it displays a screen (up to 64) files to 
the user with an arrow.  The user may use the Word Star cursor movement 
keys (^E for up, ^X for down, ^D for right, ^S for left) or the Kaypro 
cursor keys (^K for up, ^J for down, ^L for right, ^H for left) to move 
the cursor to point to a desired file.  The < and > keys will also move 
the cursor. Typing V will view the file on the CRT, P will print it on the 
printer, C will copy it, D will delete it, etc.  See the command summary 
built into VFILER.

	VFILER knows all about the DU and DIR (if installed for ZCPR2) 
forms. Under CP/M or ZCPR2, the DU form may be used.  For example, in 
response to the Login command (L), the user may type any of the following:

		A	<-- log into Disk A, Current User
		5	<-- log into Current Disk, User 5
		A5	<-- log into Disk A, User 5
		wordst	<-- log into named dir (under ZCPR2)

The entries may or may not be followed by a colon, as the user desired 
(i.e., 'A' and 'A:' mean the same thing).
