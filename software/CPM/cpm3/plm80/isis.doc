        ======================================

The ISIS environment is designed to allow 8080 based Intel tools to run on 
an 8086 PCDOS based system. The ISIS environment does not support all ISIS 
calls, but sufficient to run 8051 translators and utilities. (If the program
uses an unsupported ISIS call an error message is generated).


DOS instructions
----------------

Load the software(ISIS) onto the harddisk. If ISIS is installed in the DOS
search path it will be directly loadable by entering "ISIS".

Before entering ISIS, logical names must be set to match any ISIS disk drives
used by the ISIS tools. This includes :F0: - the ISIS environment does NOT
default to the current drive. As with 8080 ISIS, filenames without a drive
prefix are directed to :F0:.


C>SET :F0:=\ISIS            /* make sure there is no <SPACE> before the "=" */
C>SET :F1:=\BITBUS

C>ISIS                              /* invoke ISIS emulator */
DOS ISIS Environment X003
=ASM51 :F1:SAMP1.A51                /* enter ISIS commands */
...
...
=EXIT                               /* return to DOS   */


The ISIS environment will also run under DOS in batch mode

Command file (DEMO.CMD) contains:

ASM51 :F1:SAMP1.A51
ASM51 :F1:SAMP2.A51
ASM51 :F1:SAMP3.A51
RL51 :F1:SAMP1.OBJ, &
:F1:SAMP2.OBJ, &
:F1:SAMP3.OBJ TO :F1:SAMPLE
EXIT                                /* must include EXIT since all program
                                        input must be in command file 
                                        otherwise DOS will wait forever */

To invoke the command file

C>ISIS < DEMO.CMD                   /* This could be part of a batch job */

<CTRL-C> or <CTRL-BREAK> will abort the ISIS environment. You will need to 
enter <RETURN> also if the ISIS environment is at the prompt level. Also the
command "BREAK ON" should be included in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to permit DOS
to recognise <CTRL-BREAK> all the time (not just when performing DOS calls).
