The files XREF.SRC and XREF.COM as originally supplied on the MT+ 
distribution disk are the source and object of a Pascal cross-referencing 
program.  They are public domain and not specific to Pascal/MT+ (i.e.,
may be used to cross reference other Pascal programs).  They may also be 
used to cross reference other languages if the keyword table is changed.

The present version has been been somewhat customized for Pascal MT+.  
The keyword table was modified, and XREF now accepts '@' as a legal letter, 
and recognizes '_' as a letter but discards it, just as MT+ does.

1. Type XREF<cr>

2. XREF asks: Input file? <you type: full file name (e.g. A.SRC)>

3. XREF asks: Output file name? <you type: file or device name:>
   <examples:  b:myprog.src, prog2.pas, CON:, LST:>

4. XREF asks: Do you want a listing? <N means No, anything else means YES>
   <the listing includes the line numbers used in the cross-reference>

And that's it!
