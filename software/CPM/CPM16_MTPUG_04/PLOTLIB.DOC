    Enclosed is my check for the user group dues. I received  news 
 letters 1,2 and 4 but not 3. If you have any copies of number 3,
 I would appreciate a copy.
 
    I have recently gotten BLAZE/pascal utilty libraries package. The
package consists of five libraries containing handy functions and
procedures. So far I have been very impressed with the package. In
addition to several handy items which are not in standard pascal, the
bulk of the routines support data conversions to and from strings,
string editing functions, etc which can greatly improve the data input
and output portions of a program. The package also includes all the
necessary include file needed to reference the routines in your application
programs. The package sells for $200 for the source and $75 for the object
files. I got the object file package for $50 at The Trenton State Computer
Convention which my club (ACGNJ) sponsers. Starside Engineering which sells 
the package may go for a group purchase.


    Also included this disk are two programs and assorted support files.
Both programs were copied from magazines as noted and modified to run
with a MicroAngelo display board and PascalMT. While not original, the
programs are usefull and can save a lot of typing.

    The modules p1 to pn are library modules which form 'plotlib'.Programs
tplot and tplot1 test the available functions. Also included are varios
include and command files for ease of use.None of the modules are commented
except for the credits, so you must refer to the source for detailed inormation.

    The hl series is a 3d drawing package. Hl,hl1,hl2, are the drawing 
routines, and hl3 creates the input data base. I just got this program working
and it still has some not implemented functions which I left in as comments.


   Both programs use hardware dependant functions as follows:
   
     outp(B:byte); {sends a byte to MicroAngelo display
                    if b7 of the byte is set the display
                    will interpret it as a command. Commands
                    may require additional data or cause a
                    response which must be read. In these
                    programs I used the following commands
                      a) $88- clear screen
                      b) $84- set graphics cursor
                      c) $91- draw line to x,y
                      d) $B8- set alpha screen to bottom n lines
                      e) $80- set alpha mode parameters}

     micro2(command:byte;arg1,arg2:integer); {sends a command
                    and two integer operands to the MicroAngelo.
                    usually the operands are integer x and y
                    locations. Allowable x values are 0-511, y
                    may be 0-479. With 0,0 being the lower left
                    hand corner of the display.}

     at(x,y)        {position alpha cursor to x,y}
     
     intstr(num,len:integer;var result:string);
                    {converts num into a string result of length
                     len. This can be simulated by writing to a
                     file num and then reading it back as result.}
                     
   I hope the programs are of use to others. Keep up the good work.If
 you think it would be usefull I could give a more detailed review of
 Blase/Pascal in a future news letter after I have had a chance to try
 all of the features. If you are interested drop a note on the return disk.
