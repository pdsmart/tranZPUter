Indexer inputs a Pascal source file and outputs one of 
two forms of index file.  

The first is the short form:  Only the procedure and
function declarations are extracted from the source.  

The second is the long form:  All global declarations, and
everything between the keyword 'procedure' or 'function' 
and the keyword 'begin' is extracted.

Invoke indexer with the following command line:

INDEXER <SOURCE FILE> <DESTINATION FILE> [SHORT | LONG]

Short form is assumed unless LONG is specified.
