Please see the zSoft repository for the main software components of the tranZPUter/tranZPUterSW. This tree contains software for the Z80
on the tranZPUter, tools to aid in the development and configuration and other needed files. 

There is some duplication with the MZ80A_RFS project and these will be merged into a seperate repository in the future.
